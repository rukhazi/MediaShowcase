                <p>Released in 2020, Valorant is an online, team-based, first-person shooter game similar to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO). In this game, you are paired with four other players to fight against five enemy players. The objective is unchanging, regardless of the different game modes Valorant offers. When you begin a game, you are given one of two sides; Defender or Attacker sides. Attacker side’s objective is to get to a site and plant what is called a “spike” which is a bomb and defend it until it explodes. On the other hand, Defender side’s objective is to eliminate the other team and defuse the spike they planted.</p>

                <p>Minecraft is one of the most popular games in the world which gives the players access to limitless possibilities due to its sandbox nature. The player spawns in a blocky world and is given little direction. This allows the player to play however they desire. Two of the most common game modes played in the game are Survival (where players must manage their health and hunger) and Creative (where health and hunger are irrelevant and players have access to unlimited resources for building). The game also allows for online multiplayer features which enhances the Minecraft community.</p>
